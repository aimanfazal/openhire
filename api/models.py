P5 Phase 4: API request/response models.

These are transport-layer DTOs, not domain models - domain data (JobDescription,
ParsedResume, InterviewQuestion, EvidenceItem, InterviewState) comes straight
from the existing schemas (schemas/job.py, schemas/resume.py,
schemas/interview.py, schemas/evaluation.py) and is never duplicated here.
Response models only ever expose a deliberately narrow VIEW of those domain
objects - never the raw pydantic object itself, and never internal fields a
candidate should not see mid-interview (e.g. InterviewQuestion.reason, which
can contain text like "SQL evidence is insufficient (confidence 0.32)" - the
adaptive engine's own internal justification for asking this question).
